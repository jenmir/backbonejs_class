This is a first commit for the backbone.js class project.
It works in conjunction with Backlift.com. 
Class notes and getting started with Backlift at:
https://backbonedeck.backliftapp.com/ 
This starts at exercise 3a i.e. adding server-side pulls of data
in a collection, building a view and rendering.
This will not work outside of Backlift environment due to
customizations with the Handlebars template, config.yml, and other things.

j.m.
